## ðŸš€ What is InvFX?

InvFX is a **Java inventory UI framework** for Minecraft plugin developers.  
It provides a **modern, composable API** for building **custom GUIs** on Paper servers â€” while being **library-first**.

- No `JavaPlugin` entry point.
- No heavy setup.
- Just **shade the API** into your own plugin and build inventories like real UI components.

---

## âœ¨ Features (alpha stage)

- **API-first design** â€” clear separation of `api`, `spi`, `impl`, and `binding` packages.
- **Views** â€” describe what should be displayed (`PagedView`, `ConfirmView`, `ListView`, etc.).
- **Render pipeline** â€” efficient diff-based updates, only changed slots are redrawn.
- **Controllers & Events** â€” handle clicks, drags, closes, opens, cursor changes.
- **Adapters** â€” Bukkit/Paper bindings are thin and optional, keeping the core platform-agnostic.
- **Extras** â€” pre-built components: nav bars, confirm dialogs, search inputs, animated toasts.
- **Test-friendly** â€” ships with mock adapters and schedulers so you can unit test without Bukkit.
- **Shade-ready** â€” designed to be relocated into your plugin to avoid conflicts.

## ðŸ›  Examples

### Example 1 â€” Confirm Dialog
```java
var mm = MiniMessage.miniMessage();

ConfirmView confirm = new ConfirmView(
    mm.deserialize("<yellow>Delete item?"),
    invfx.getItemProvider(),
    result -> {
        if (result) {
            player.sendMessage("Item deleted!");
        } else {
            player.sendMessage("Cancelled.");
        }
    }
);

invfx.open(player, confirm);
```

### Example 2 - Simple List
```java
ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>(
    List.of("Sword", "Bow", "Shield"),
    invfx.getItemProvider(),
    5, // content rows
    item -> MiniMessage.miniMessage().deserialize("<aqua>" + item),
    selected -> player.sendMessage("You picked: " + selected)
);

invfx.open(player, listView);
```
